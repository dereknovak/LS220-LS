recursion to solve a binary tree problem

lessons are trickier than they should be on the assessment

exercise problems to study for assessment

assessment just like 216

visual trick
    - When using a test case, line up `a` and `r` with an array

binary tree is the linked list
graphs are an extention of binary tree

/*
This interview will assess your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, with a particular focus on problem-solving skills. Please prepare thoroughly using this study guide. Refer to the course policy for information on retakes.

During the interview, you will be given a coding challenge to solve within 45 minutes. You are expected to follow the problem-solving approach covered in our course:

Understand the problem
Develop examples/test cases
Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms
Verify your algorithm against the examples
Implement your solution
Test Cases and Problem-Solving Approach
As part of the assessment:

You will be given an initial problem statement
You are expected to develop your own test cases to cover various scenarios, including edge cases
Demonstrate your problem-solving approach step-by-step
If desired, you may use the Drawing tool on Coderpad to illustrate your thought process
You will be evaluated on your ability to:

Construct and articulate a clear plan for solving the given problem
Apply appropriate data structures and algorithms to the problem at hand
Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code
Validate your assumptions and debug any issues that arise
Identify opportunities for optimization in your solution
